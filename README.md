## What's this?

This is a CLI that uses [`node-id3`](https://github.com/Zazama/node-id3) to mark
[ID3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3) tags into MP3 files.
This allows you to quickly and easily include things like the album, artist, song name, composers,
genre and cover art into your MP3 files.

- Yarn: `yarn global add @santi100a/mp3-meta`
- PNPM: `pnpm install --global @santi100a/mp3-meta`

## Usage
